# Zephyr

## Tech Stack

**Framework**: Next.js v14
**Database**: MongoDB
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
**Authentication**: next-auth

Zephyr is a weather app built with Next.js, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, and next-auth for authentication. It provides real-time weather information to users, helping them stay informed about current weather conditions in various locations. I know that a weather app like this could provide more data to the end user, but making this project was more a **excercise** which introduces me to the NextJS app router than a serious work. I didn't cared much about my versioning structure so i hadn't chosen any GIT workflow like Gitflow or GithubFlow.
