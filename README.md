# Zephyr

[**Zephyr**](https://zephyr-eta.vercel.app) is a weather app, It provides real-time weather information to users, helping them stay informed about current weather conditions in various locations. I know that a weather app like this could provide more data to the end user, but making this project was more a **excercise** which introduces me to the NextJS app router than a serious work. I didn't cared much about my versioning structure so i hadn't chosen any GIT workflow like Gitflow or GithubFlow.

**You can**:

1. check real-time weather and 7-day weather forecast
2. get information about sun rise and set times and moon phases
3. create an account and manage it
4. check, at which places you check the weather the most
5. change unit settings to your preference
